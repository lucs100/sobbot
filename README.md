# sobbot - an indiscriminate discord bot 

Repository for Sobbot, a personal Discord bot.
Sobbot is mainly a side project intended for me to gain experience using Python as an interface between Discord, Sobbot's logic, and various API's, with a lot of random features thrown in as well. This is intentional - Sobbot isn't really intended to be a general use Discord bot, but rather a compilation of tons of side projects too small for their own repoitories, wrapped into a Discord bot.

However, you're more than welcome to use Sobbot's code as a starter for your own bot, or even verbatim rebranded as your own bot. Read the LICENSE for more info on this.
Instructions for setting up Sobbot as your own bot:

1. Set up a bot on Discord's developer portal, and acquire its token.
2. Create a file named .env in /bot, and paste `DISCORDTOKEN=yourTokenHere`.
3. Add your bot to a server using a bot link.
4. Run bot/bot.py.

Use s!help for help with Sobbot's commands.

Sobbot's default prefix is s!, which is immutable at the moment.
