Personal projects such as Sobbot have very strict rate limits:\n**10 requests every second**\n**100 requests every 2 minutes**\nApps which egreiously hit their rate limits can have their key banned from the API. Sobbot's functions are designed to have a kill switch in the case of hitting a rate limit and will never hit a rate limit in a single use. However, multiple uses of functions will often hit the rate cap. For example, `livematch` makes ~32 requests to the api. This isn't a problem, however, please avoid hitting the rate cap too much as it risks Sobbot reveiving a ban from Riot's API. Loss of this key would all but kill the project."
