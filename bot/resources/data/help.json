Sobbot's functions are designed to have a kill switch in the case of hitting a rate limit and will never hit a rate limit in a single use. However, multiple uses of functions will often hit the rate cap. For example, `livematch` makes ~32 requests to the api. This isn't a problem, however, please avoid hitting the rate cap too much as it risks Sobbot reveiving a ban from Riot's API. Loss of this key would all but kill the project."

This isn't actually 'registering' an account, but rather adding your Discord ID and related info to the database so your data can be saved and updated later! The most common use of registration with Sobbot is the LoL commands - using the `register (summonerName)` command, you can link your summoner name to your Discord ID. The next time you use a LoL command, you won't have to type your summoner name - if you leave the `summonerName` parameter blank on any command, it'll automatically use your registered summoner name as a default. This is also true for other command subsets - check out their help embeds (`help`) for more info!"
