Sobbot's functions are designed to have a kill switch in the case of hitting a rate limit and will never hit a rate limit in a single use. However, multiple uses of functions will often hit the rate cap. For example, `livematch` makes ~32 requests to the API. This isn't a problem, however, please avoid hitting the rate cap too much as it risks Sobbot reveiving a ban from Riot's API. Loss of this key would all but kill the project."

The most common use of registration with Sobbot is the LoL commands - using the `register (summonerName)` command, you can link your summoner name to your Discord ID. The next time you use a LoL command, you won't have to type your summoner name - if you leave the `summonerName` parameter blank on any command, it'll automatically use your registered summoner name as a default.
